Features

Real-Time Song Recognition: The application listens to songs in the user's vicinity, similar to Shazam, and identifies them using a pre-existing song database.
Automated Voting System: Each time a song is recognized, it receives a vote, which is tracked and recorded.
Monthly Data Collection: Throughout the year, the app collects votes for each recognized song.
Year-End Compilation: During the last month of the year, the app compiles all the votes and lists the songs of the year based on the total number of votes received.
Fair and Democratic: By using actual song recognition data, the selection of the top songs is unbiased and reflective of real-world listening habits.
