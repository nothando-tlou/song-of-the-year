Features

Real-Time Song Recognition:he application leverages advanced AI algorithms to listen to and identify songs in the user's vicinity, similar to Shazam. It uses a sophisticated neural network trained on a vast database of pre-existing songs to provide accurate and fast song recognition.

Automated Voting System: Each time a song is recognized, it receives an automated vote, which is tracked and recorded in real-time. The AI system ensures that each recognition is accurately counted towards the song's total votes.

Monthly Data Collection: The app continuously collects votes for each recognized song throughout the year. The AI system organizes and maintains this data efficiently, ensuring that every vote is accounted for.

Year-End Compilation
During the last month of the year, the app utilizes AI to compile and analyze all the votes collected over the year. It then generates a list of the top songs based on the total number of votes received, reflecting genuine listening habits.


Fair and Democratic:
By using AI-driven song recognition data, the selection of the top songs is unbiased and truly reflective of real-world listening trends. This ensures a fair and democratic process for determining the "Songs of the Year."


Project Status

This is an ongoing project currently in progress. Key AI-powered features are being developed and tested to ensure accurate song recognition and reliable vote counting. Contributions and feedback are welcome as the project evolves.

Future Enhancements

Developing a user-friendly interface for easier interaction with the app.
Community Features - Implementing a feature for users to share and discuss the "Song of the Year" results so we know it was decided by the community.
